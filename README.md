# Private Events

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations)

*"...build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location"*

*"A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users"*

View the completed project live on [Heroku]() (*In progress*)
